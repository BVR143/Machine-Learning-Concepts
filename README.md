## Machine-Learning-Concepts

### `One-Hot Encoding`
The Main purpose is to make easy for Machine Learning Algorithms beacause machine can understand only numerical values
One-hot Encoding is a technique used in Machine learning and data preprocessing to convert the `categorical` variables into `Numerical` variables (Binary numbers) 0s and 1s, where each category becomes a seperate binary feature. Each seperated features represents the presence(1) or obsence(0) of the particular category

### `Feature Engineering`
Feature Engineering is the process of `Creating new features` using the existing one or `Modifying the existing features` of the dataset to `improve the performance of a machine learning model` 


### `Outliers`
Before looking for `Outliers`, Let us first address the quetions like:
##### What are Outliers abd Why do we need to remove them ? 

`Outliers` are Nothing, But the points that are significatlty different from the majority of the data in dataset.
